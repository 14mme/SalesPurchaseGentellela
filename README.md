## Minimum System Requirements
To be able to run Laravel Boilerplate you have to meet the following requirements:
- PHP 5.5.9 or higher
- PDO PHP Extension
- cURL PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Labs64/laravel-boilerplate.git
```
```
$ composer install --prefer-dist
```
```
$ npm install
```

### Database setup

Edit `.env.example` according to your environment and save as `.env`.
An application key can be generated with the command `php artisan key:generate`.

Run these commands to create the tables within the database you have already created.

```
$ php artisan migrate:install
```
```
$ php artisan migrate:refresh
```

If you get an error like a `PDOException` try editing your `.env` file and change `DB_HOST=localhost` to `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

## Run

To provide the JS and CSS files and to keep track of changes to these files:
```
$ gulp && gulp watch
```

To start the PHP built-in server:
```
$ php -S localhost:8080 -t public/
```

Now you can browse the site  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). ðŸ™Œ
